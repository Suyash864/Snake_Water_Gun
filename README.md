# Snake Water Gun Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Snake Water Gun" game, similar to "Rock Paper Scissors."
In this game, you can choose between three options—snake, water, and gun—to play against the computer.

## Game Rules

- If both you and the computer choose the same option, it's a draw.
- The winner is determined based on the following logic:
  - Snake (0) vs. Gun (2): Snake wins
  - Gun (2) vs. Water (1): Gun wins
  - Water (1) vs. Snake (0): Water wins

## Replay

After each game, you'll be asked if you want to play again. Type "yes" to continue or "no" to exit the game.
